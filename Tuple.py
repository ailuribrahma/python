#Tuple is same as List it's represent collection of values like list
#but small change is Tuple is immutable List is mutable 
#immutable menas we can't change value while mutable is change value
#List is using squre brakets[] but Tuple is uing round brakets()

#when use Tuple ? we have a list but we do't want to change values in sartain projects
#itaration is faster then List enhance excustion time

#represent of tuple below
tuple = (20,30,40,50)
#print(tuple)

#find index value tuple
print(tuple[2])
